(A) This folder runs spark in local mode / macbook (not in standalone mode or  cluster mode).
	So it does not use Mesos/YARN as cluster manager
	So it does not use HDFS or S3 as file system
(B) Spark in EMR examples are in Udacity/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/Basic-Exercises/Exercises-Data-Lake-Spark
	(B1) Look in the file .....Basic-Exercises/Exercises-Data-Lake-Spark/EMR-Notes.txt for details to run Spark in EMR
	(B2) Udacity/Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/Basic-Exercises/Exercises-Data-Lake-Spark also has Python code / SDK / boto3 
             to programmatically spin up / down EMR cluster
	(B3) EMR uses HDFS/S3 and also YARN/Mesos. Files are read/written either from/to HDFS (default) or S3
